# Typography

Typography rendering details that make interfaces feel better.

## Text Wrapping

### text-wrap: balance

Distributes text evenly across lines, preventing orphaned words on headings and short text blocks. **Only works on blocks of 6 lines or fewer** (Chromium) or 10 lines or fewer (Firefox) — the balancing algorithm is computationally expensive, so browsers limit it to short text.

```css
/* Good — even line lengths on short text */
h1, h2, h3 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}
```

```css
/* Bad — default wrapping leaves orphans */
h1 {
  /* no text-wrap rule → "Read our
     blog" instead of balanced lines */
}
```

```css
/* Bad — balance on long paragraphs (silently ignored, wastes intent) */
.article-body p {
  text-wrap: balance;
}
```

**Tailwind:** `text-balance`

### text-wrap: pretty

Prevents orphaned words (a single word dangling on the last line) by adjusting line breaks throughout the paragraph. Unlike `balance`, it doesn't try to equalize line lengths — it just ensures the last line isn't embarrassingly short. Works on text of any length with no line-count limit.

This should be your **default for short-to-medium text** — paragraphs, descriptions, captions, list items, card text. For very long text (10+ lines), skip both `pretty` and `balance` — the browser's default wrapping is fine and you avoid unnecessary layout cost.

```css
/* Good — descriptions, captions, short paragraphs */
p, li, figcaption, blockquote {
  text-wrap: pretty;
}
```

```tsx
// Tailwind
<p className="text-pretty">
  A short paragraph that won't leave an orphan on the last line.
</p>
```

**Tailwind:** `text-pretty`

### When to Use Which

| Scenario | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Headings, titles where even distribution matters | `text-wrap: balance` |
| Short-to-medium text — paragraphs, descriptions, captions, UI text | `text-wrap: pretty` |
| Long text (10+ lines), code blocks, pre-formatted text | Neither — leave default |

## Font Smoothing (macOS)

On macOS, text renders heavier than intended by default. Apply antialiased smoothing to the root layout so all text renders crisper and thinner.

```css
/* CSS */
html {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

```tsx
// Tailwind — apply to root layout
<html className="antialiased">
```

### Good vs. Bad

```css
/* Good — applied once at the root */
html {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

/* Bad — applied per-element, inconsistent */
.heading {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
.body {
  /* no smoothing → heavier than heading */
}
```

**Note:** This only affects macOS rendering. Other platforms ignore these properties, so it's safe to apply universally.

## Font Family Scope

This skill does not require a specific font family. Do not introduce a paid or proprietary typeface just to satisfy the polish checklist.

Use the product's existing type system unless the task explicitly asks for a type change. If the design calls for a system-native macOS feel, use the system font stack. If the design calls for a commercial face such as Helvetica Now, treat it as an optional brand decision and keep a practical fallback stack.

```css
/* System-native macOS/iOS feel */
html {
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
}
```

```css
/* Commercial brand face with safe fallbacks */
html {
  font-family: "Helvetica Now", "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

**Rule:** font smoothing, text wrapping, and tabular numbers are rendering details. They do not override the project's chosen font family.

## Tabular Numbers

When numbers update dynamically (counters, prices, timers, table columns), use tabular-nums to make all digits equal width. This prevents layout shift as values change.

```css
/* CSS */
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
}
```

```tsx
// Tailwind
<span className="tabular-nums">{count}</span>
```

### When to Use

| Use tabular-nums | Don't use tabular-nums |
| --- | --- |
| Counters and timers | Static display numbers |
| Prices that update | Decorative large numbers |
| Table columns with numbers | Phone numbers, zip codes |
| Animated number transitions | Version numbers (v2.1.0) |
| Scoreboards, dashboards | |

### Caveat

Some fonts (like Inter) change the visual appearance of numerals with this property — specifically, the digit `1` becomes wider and centered. This is expected behavior and usually desirable for alignment, but verify it looks right in your specific font.

```css
/* With Inter font:
   Default:  1234  → proportional, "1" is narrow
   Tabular:  1234  → all digits equal width, "1" centered */
```
