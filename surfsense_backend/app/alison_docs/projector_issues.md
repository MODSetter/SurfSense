# Classroom Projector Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Projector Not Turning On

**Symptoms:**
- The projector is unresponsive to the remote control or power button.
- The power indicator light is off.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Check Power Cable:** Ensure the projector's power cable is securely plugged into both the projector and a working power outlet.
2.  **Test Outlet:** Plug another device into the same outlet to confirm it's receiving power.
3.  **Use Power Button:** Try turning on the projector using the physical power button on the unit itself, in case the remote's batteries are dead.

**Role-Specific Advice:**
-   **Professor:** If the above steps don't work, please contact a proctor or IT support for assistance.
-   **Proctor:** If the outlet is working and the projector still won't turn on, it may be an issue with the projector itself. Please escalate to IT support and note the room number and projector model.

## Issue: No Image Displayed (Projector is On)

**Symptoms:**
- The projector is on (power light is on, fan is running), but no image is displayed on the screen.
- A "No Signal" message is displayed.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Check Source Cable:** Ensure the HDMI or VGA cable is securely connected to both the computer and the projector.
2.  **Select Correct Source:** Use the "Source" or "Input" button on the remote or projector to cycle through the available input sources (e.g., HDMI 1, HDMI 2, VGA).
3.  **Check Computer's Display Settings:**
    -   **Windows:** Press `Windows Key + P` and select "Duplicate" or "Extend".
    -   **Mac:** Go to "System Preferences" > "Displays" and check the "Arrangement" tab.
4.  **Restart Devices:** Try restarting both the computer and the projector.

**Role-Specific Advice:**
-   **Professor:** Many classroom systems require you to select the source via a wall-mounted control panel. Please check for a control panel and select the correct input.
-   **Proctor:** If the professor has tried all the above steps, please verify the cable connections and assist with the display settings. If the issue persists, try connecting a different laptop to rule out a problem with the user's device.

## Issue: Blurry or Distorted Image

**Symptoms:**
- The projected image is out of focus, blurry, or has incorrect colors.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Adjust Focus Ring:** Use the focus ring on the projector's lens to sharpen the image.
2.  **Adjust Keystone Correction:** If the image is trapezoidal, use the keystone correction buttons on the remote or projector to square the image.
3.  **Check Resolution:** Ensure the computer's display resolution is set to the projector's native resolution (usually found in the projector's manual or on the manufacturer's website).

**Role-Specific Advice:**
-   **Professor:** The focus and keystone rings are usually located on the lens of the projector. Feel free to adjust them to get a clear image.
-   **Proctor:** If the image colors are distorted, check for bent pins on the VGA cable (if applicable) or try a different cable. If the issue persists, the projector's bulb may be nearing the end of its life. Please report this to IT support.
