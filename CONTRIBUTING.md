## 📌 What Can You Work On?

There are 3 main ways to contribute:

### ✅ 1. Pick From the Roadmap
We maintain a public roadmap with well-scoped issues and features you can work on:  
🔗 [NeoNote GitHub Project Roadmap](https://github.com/users/MODSetter/projects/2)

> 💡 **Tip**: Look for tasks in `Backlog` or `Ready` status.

### 💡 2. Propose Something New
Have an idea that's not on the roadmap?

1. First, check for an existing issue
2. If it doesn't exist, create a new issue explaining your feature or enhancement
3. Wait for feedback from maintainers
4. Once approved, you're welcome to start working on a PR!

### 🐞 3. Report Bugs or Fix Them
Found a bug? Create an issue with:

- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Environment details** (OS, browser, version)
- **Any relevant logs or screenshots**

Want to fix it? Go for it! Just link the issue in your PR.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (recommended) OR manual setup
- **Node.js** (v18+ for web frontend)
- **Python** (v3.11+ for backend)
- **PostgreSQL** with **PGVector** extension
- **API Keys** for external services you're testing

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MODSetter/NeoNote.git
   cd NeoNote
   ```

2. **Choose your setup method**:
   - **Docker Setup**: Follow the [Docker Setup Guide](./DOCKER_SETUP.md)
   - **Manual Setup**: Follow the [Installation Guide](https://www.neonote.com/docs/)

3. **Configure services**:
   - Set up PGVector & PostgreSQL
   - Configure a file ETL service: `Unstructured.io` or `LlamaIndex`
   - Add API keys for external services

For detailed setup instructions, refer to our [Installation Guide](https://www.neonote.com/docs/).

## 🏗️ Project Structure

NeoNote consists of three main components:

- **`surfsense_backend/`** - Python/FastAPI backend service
- **`surfsense_web/`** - Next.js web application
- **`surfsense_browser_extension/`** - Browser extension for data collection

## 🧪 Development Guidelines

### Code Quality & Pre-commit Hooks
We use pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality, security, and consistency across the codebase. Before you start developing:

1. **Install and set up pre-commit hooks** - See our detailed [Pre-commit Guide](./PRE_COMMIT.md)
2. **Understand the automated checks** that will run on your code
3. **Learn about bypassing hooks** when necessary (use sparingly!)

### Code Style
- **Backend**: Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Frontend**: Use TypeScript and follow the existing code patterns
- **Formatting**: Use the project's configured formatters (Black for Python, Prettier for TypeScript)

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: add document search functionality
fix: resolve pagination issue in chat history
docs: update installation guide
refactor: improve error handling in connectors
```

### Testing
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting
- Include integration tests for API endpoints

### Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-document-search`
- `fix/pagination-issue`
- `docs/update-contributing-guide`

2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
3. **Make your changes** following the coding guidelines
