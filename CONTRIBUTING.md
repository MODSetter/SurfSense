# Contributing to SurfSense

Hey! 👋 Thanks for checking out **SurfSense**. We're stoked that you're interested in helping improve the project. Whether it's fixing bugs, suggesting features, improving docs, or just joining the conversation — every bit helps.

## 🧠 Before You Start

**Join Our Discord**  
Want to stay in the loop, ask questions, or get feedback before starting something?  
Hop into the official SurfSense community:

That's where the *latest updates*, *internal discussions*, and *collaborations* happen.

## 📌 What Can You Work On?

There are 3 main ways to contribute:

### ✅ 1. Pick From the Roadmap
We maintain a public roadmap with well-scoped issues and features you can work on:  
🔗 [SurfSense GitHub Project Roadmap](https://github.com/users/MODSetter/projects/2)

> 💡 **Tip**: Look for tasks in `Backlog` or `Ready` status.

### 💡 2. Propose Something New
Have an idea that's not on the roadmap?

1. First, check for an existing issue
2. If it doesn't exist, create a new issue explaining your feature or enhancement
3. Wait for feedback from maintainers
4. Once approved, you're welcome to start working on a PR!

### 🐞 3. Report Bugs or Fix Them
Found a bug? Create an issue with:

- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Environment details** (OS, browser, version)
- **Any relevant logs or screenshots**

Want to fix it? Go for it! Just link the issue in your PR.

## 🌿 Branching Workflow

We follow a **branch protection model** to keep `main` stable:

| Branch | Purpose | Who can merge |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `main` | Stable/release branch | Maintainers only (from `dev`) |
| `dev` | Active development & integration | Via approved PRs from contributors |
| `feature/*`, `fix/*`, etc. | Individual work branches | Contributors create PRs to `dev` |

### Important Rules

- **All contributor PRs must target the `dev` branch.** PRs targeting `main` will not be accepted.
- `main` is updated exclusively by maintainers merging from `dev` when a release is ready.
- Always create your feature/fix branches from the latest `dev`.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (recommended) OR manual setup
- **Node.js** (v18+ for web frontend)
- **Python** (v3.11+ for backend)
- **PostgreSQL** with **PGVector** extension
- **API Keys** for external services you're testing

### Quick Start
1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SurfSense.git
   cd SurfSense
   ```

2. **Create your branch from `dev`**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Choose your setup method**:
   - **Docker Setup**: Follow the [Docker Setup Guide](./DOCKER_SETUP.md)
   - **Manual Setup**: Follow the [Installation Guide](https://www.surfsense.com/docs/)

4. **Configure services**:
   - Set up PGVector & PostgreSQL
   - Configure a file ETL service: `Unstructured.io` or `LlamaIndex`
   - Add API keys for external services

For detailed setup instructions, refer to our [Installation Guide](https://www.surfsense.com/docs/).

## 🏗️ Project Structure

SurfSense consists of three main components:

- **`surfsense_backend/`** - Python/FastAPI backend service
- **`surfsense_web/`** - Next.js web application
- **`surfsense_browser_extension/`** - Browser extension for data collection

## 🧪 Development Guidelines

### Code Quality & Pre-commit Hooks
We use pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality, security, and consistency across the codebase. Before you start developing:

1. **Install and set up pre-commit hooks** - See our detailed [Pre-commit Guide](./PRE_COMMIT.md)
2. **Understand the automated checks** that will run on your code
3. **Learn about bypassing hooks** when necessary (use sparingly!)

### Code Style
- **Backend**: Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Frontend**: Use TypeScript and follow the existing code patterns
- **Formatting**: Use the project's configured formatters (Black for Python, Prettier for TypeScript)

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: add document search functionality
fix: resolve pagination issue in chat history
docs: update installation guide
refactor: improve error handling in connectors
```

### Testing
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting
- Include integration tests for API endpoints

### Branch Naming
Create branches from `dev` with descriptive names:
- `feature/add-document-search`
- `fix/pagination-issue`
- `docs/update-contributing-guide`

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Create an issue** first (unless it's a minor fix)
2. **Fork the repository** and create a branch from `dev`
3. **Make your changes** following the coding guidelines
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Open a PR targeting the `dev` branch**

> **Note:** PRs targeting `main` will **not** be reviewed or merged. If you accidentally open a PR to `main`, please retarget it to `dev`.

### PR Requirements
- **Target the `dev` branch** — this is mandatory
- **One feature or fix per PR** - keep changes focused
- **Link related issues** in the PR description
- **Include screenshots or demos** for UI changes
- **Write descriptive PR title and description**
- **Ensure CI passes** before requesting review


## 🔍 Code Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD pipeline)
2. **At least one maintainer** will review your PR
3. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
4. **Squash commits** if requested to keep history clean
5. **Celebrate** when your PR gets merged! 🎉
