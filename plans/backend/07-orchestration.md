# Phase 7 — Orchestration / Conversation (the CI-expert subagent)

> Build last; sits atop `04`/`05` (and `06` for the ongoing mode).
> The multi-agent chat runtime (deepagents, subagent dispatch, streaming, citation middleware) is shipped.
> Net-new here = one builtin subagent + its tools + its prompt. Locate code by symbol/grep.

## Objective

Ship the `intelligence_agent` — a builtin CI/scraper-expert subagent that delivers the product through
plain conversation: understand intent, compose scraper verbs (`04`), answer in plain language, and hand
standing needs to the ongoing "keep watching" mode (`06`). It reasons over chat history to report what's
new vs prior tool outputs already in context.

## The subagent

New builtin `subagents/builtins/intelligence_agent/`, peer to `research`/`deliverables`, packed via
`pack_subagent`. Files follow the existing pattern: `agent.py` (`build_subagent`), `tools/index.py`
(`NAME · RULESET · load_tools`), `description.md` (router one-liner), `system_prompt.md` (the playbook).
The main agent delegates CI-/scraping-flavored requests to it via `description.md`.

## The playbook (`system_prompt.md`)

1. **Intent routing** — one-shot ("compare/find/what is") → compose verbs & answer; standing concern
   ("watch/track/notify when/weekly") → hand to `06`; ambiguous → ask one question ("just once, or keep
   watching?").
2. **Verb composition** — chains `web.discover → web.scrape` and `maps.search → maps.place → maps.reviews`;
   infer URLs/queries/locations from context.
3. **"What changed"** — re-invoke the verb and compare against prior tool outputs in the chat history,
   summarizing what's new.

## The toolset (`load_tools`)

| Tool | Wraps | Billing |
|------|-------|---------|
| capability verbs (`web.scrape`, `web.discover`, `maps.search`, `maps.place`, `maps.reviews`) | `04` executors (direct-return) | `03c` turn accumulator (as `scrape_webpage` does) |
| `start_watch(intent)` *(deferred)* | hands off to `06` | per re-invocation (design with `06`) |

Capability verbs are a shared, registry-generated tool module (`04`) that `research` can also load; the
`intelligence_agent` adds the CI prompt and the `06` handoff.

## Boundaries

- The subagent drives the `04` verbs via tools; fetch/bypass/clean logic stays in Acquisition + `04`,
  callable headless.
- Humans get the agent; REST/MCP callers call `04` verbs directly, skipping this subagent.

## Work items

1. Subagent scaffold: `subagents/builtins/intelligence_agent/` (`agent.py` / `tools/index.py` /
   `description.md` / `system_prompt.md`), packed via `pack_subagent`.
2. CI playbook prompt: intent routing (one clarifying question), verb chains, "what changed" reasoning.
3. Shared verb tool module: registry-backed (`04`), reusable by `research`.
4. `start_watch` seam to `06` (wired when `06` is designed).
5. Router registration: `description.md` for main-agent delegation.

## Tests

- A CI-/scraping-flavored request routes to `intelligence_agent`; a non-CI request does not.
- "compare X and Y" composes verbs and answers in plain language, persisting nothing.
- "reviews for the top 3 coffee shops near me" chains `maps.search → maps.place → maps.reviews`.
- A follow-up re-invokes the verb and reports new items vs prior in-context outputs.
- "watch this weekly" routes to the ongoing mode, not a one-shot answer.

## Out of scope

- Verbs, doors → `04`/`05`. Ongoing/periodic mechanism → `06`.
- Richer multi-step playbooks, proactive suggestions, cross-topic synthesis.
- Frontend CI surfaces → frontend umbrella.

## Open questions

- Whether CI one-shot scraping stays in `research` or the `intelligence_agent` owns all CI-flavored calls.
- The `start_watch` handoff shape (settled with `06`).
