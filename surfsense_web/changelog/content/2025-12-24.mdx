## What's New in v0.0.9

This release introduces the **SurfSense Agent**, a shift from pre-determined workflows (DAG) to dynamic, LLM-driven decision making.

- **Smarter Source Selection**: Intelligently searches all connected sources based on your query, not just the ones you specify
- **Temporal Queries**: Understands time-based questions like *"Slack messages from last week"*
- **Reasoning & Refinement**: Iteratively refines answers for better accuracy
- **Better Prompt Handling**: Knows when to respond in chat vs generate a podcast
- **Faster Indexing**: Improved speed when syncing connected sources
- **MCP Compatibility**: Extensible architecture supporting Model Context Protocol servers
