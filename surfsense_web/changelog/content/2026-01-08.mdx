- **Simplified OAuth Authentication**: All supported connectors have been migrated to OAuth, making setup faster and more secure across your enterprise search software stack.
- **Multi-Account Support**: Connect multiple accounts for the same service (e.g., Personal and Work Google Drives) to unify all your data sources in one AI-powered search hub.
