# Luma Integration Setup Guide

This guide walks you through connecting your Luma events to SurfSense for event search and AI-powered insights.

## How it works

The Luma connector uses the Luma API to fetch all events that your API key has access to.

- For follow-up indexing runs, the connector retrieves events that have been updated since the last indexing attempt.
- Indexing should be configured to run periodically, so updates should appear in your search results within minutes.
