# Circleback Integration Setup Guide

This guide walks you through connecting your Circleback meetings to SurfSense for meeting search and AI-powered insights.

## How it works

The Circleback connector uses a **webhook-based integration**. Unlike other connectors that pull data from APIs, Circleback automatically pushes meeting data to SurfSense when meetings are processed.

- Meetings are sent to SurfSense immediately after Circleback processes them
- No API keys or credentials required
- No periodic indexing needed - data arrives in real-time
- Each meeting is stored with its notes, transcript, action items, and insights

## What Gets Indexed

| Content Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Meeting Notes | AI-generated meeting notes in Markdown format |
| Transcript | Full meeting transcript with speaker identification and timestamps |
| Action Items | Tasks with assignees and status |
| Attendees | Names and emails of meeting participants |
| Insights | Custom insights extracted from the meeting |
| Metadata | Date, duration, tags, meeting URL, and Circleback link |

<Callout type="info">
    Meeting recordings are not stored in SurfSense, but a link to the recording (valid for 24 hours from Circleback) is included in the indexed document.
</Callout>

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create the Connector in SurfSense

1. Navigate to **Connectors** → **Add Connector** → **Circleback**
2. Enter a connector name (e.g., `My Circleback Meetings`)
3. Click **Connect** to create the connector

<Callout type="info" title="No Credentials Needed">
Circleback uses webhooks, so no API key or authentication is required. The webhook URL is unique to your search space.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Copy Your Webhook URL

After creating the connector:

1. Open the connector settings
2. Find the **Webhook URL** field
3. Click **Copy** to copy the URL to your clipboard

The webhook URL looks like:
```
https://your-surfsense-url/api/v1/webhooks/circleback/{search_space_id}
```

### Step 3: Configure Circleback Automation

1. Log into your [Circleback account](https://app.circleback.ai)
2. Go to **Automations** (in the main navigation)
3. Click **Create automation**
4. Add conditions to filter which meetings trigger the webhook (optional):
   - Specific calendar(s)
   - Meeting tags
   - Meeting participants
5. Select **Send webhook request** as the action
6. Enter your SurfSense webhook URL
7. Select the meeting outcomes to include (notes, action items, transcript, insights)
8. Optionally test with your most recent meeting
9. Name and save the automation

For detailed instructions, see [Circleback's official webhook documentation](https://circleback.ai/docs/webhook-integration).

<Callout type="warn">
    Make sure your SurfSense backend is accessible from the internet for Circleback to send webhooks. If self-hosting, you may need to configure a reverse proxy or use a tunneling service.
</Callout>

## Connector Configuration

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Connector Name** | A friendly name to identify this connector | Yes |

<Callout type="info">
    Unlike other connectors, Circleback doesn't support periodic indexing since it's webhook-based. Meetings are automatically pushed to SurfSense when processed by Circleback.
</Callout>

## Verifying the Integration

Once configured, new meetings will automatically appear in SurfSense after Circleback processes them. To verify:

1. Attend or process a meeting with Circleback
2. Wait for Circleback to complete processing (usually a few minutes after the meeting ends)
3. Check your SurfSense search space for the new meeting document

Each meeting document includes:
- A direct link to view the meeting on Circleback
- Full searchable transcript
- Extracted action items with assignees
- Meeting metadata and insights

---

## Troubleshooting

**Meetings not appearing**
- Verify the webhook URL is correctly configured in Circleback
- Check that your SurfSense backend is accessible from the internet
- Look for errors in your SurfSense backend logs

**Webhook URL not showing**
- Refresh the connector configuration page
- Ensure the connector was created successfully
- Check that your backend is running

**Duplicate meetings**
- Each meeting is uniquely identified by its Circleback meeting ID
- If content changes, the existing document is updated rather than duplicated

**Delayed indexing**
- Meeting data is processed asynchronously
- Documents should appear within a minute of receiving the webhook
- Check the task queue if experiencing longer delays
