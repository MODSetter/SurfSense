# BookStack Integration Setup Guide

This guide walks you through connecting your BookStack instance to SurfSense.

## How it works

The BookStack connector uses the BookStack REST API to fetch all pages from your BookStack instance that your account has access to.

- For follow up indexing runs, the connector retrieves pages that have been updated since the last indexing attempt.
- Indexing should be configured to run periodically, so updates should appear in your search results within minutes.

## Authorization

<Callout type="info" title="API Token Required">
You need to create an API token from your BookStack instance. The token requires "Access System API" permission.
</Callout>

### Step 1: Create an API Token

1. Log in to your BookStack instance
2. Click on your profile icon → Edit Profile
3. Navigate to the "API Tokens" tab
4. Click "Create Token" and give it a name
5. Copy both the **Token ID** and **Token Secret**
6. Paste them in the connector form

### Step 2: Grant necessary access

Your user account must have "Access System API" permission. The connector will only index content your account can view.

<Callout type="info" title="Rate Limiting">
BookStack API has a rate limit of 180 requests per minute. The connector automatically handles rate limiting to ensure reliable indexing.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Periodic Sync">
Enable periodic sync to automatically re-index pages when content changes. Available frequencies: Every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, hourly, every 6 hours, daily, or weekly.
</Callout>
