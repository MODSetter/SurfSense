## Limitations & Unsupported Content

Notion's API has limitations on certain block types that cannot be retrieved. SurfSense will automatically skip these unsupported blocks and continue syncing all other content.

### Unsupported Block Types

The following Notion features are **not accessible via the Notion API** and will be skipped during sync:

- **Transcription blocks** - Audio/video transcriptions from Notion AI
- **AI blocks** - AI-generated content blocks

### Learn More

The Notion API only supports specific block types for retrieval. The official list of **supported block types** is documented in Notion's Block reference:

- **[Block Object Reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block)** - Official documentation listing all supported block types. Any block type not listed here (such as `transcription` and `ai_block`) is not accessible via the Notion API.
